    "description": "Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that lets you use standard SQL to\nanalyze data directly in Amazon S3. You can point Athena at your data in Amazon\nS3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds. Athena is serverless, so\nthere is no infrastructure to set up or manage. You pay only for the queries you\nrun. Athena scales automatically—executing queries in parallel—so results are\nfast, even with large datasets and complex queries. For more information, see \nWhat is Amazon Athena [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html] \nin the Amazon Athena User Guide.\n\nIf you connect to Athena using the JDBC driver, use version 1.1.0 of the driver\nor later with the Amazon Athena API. Earlier version drivers do not support the\nAPI. For more information and to download the driver, see Accessing Amazon\nAthena with JDBC\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html].\n\nFor code samples using the AWS SDK for Java, see Examples and Code Samples\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/code-samples.html] in the Amazon\nAthena User Guide.",
